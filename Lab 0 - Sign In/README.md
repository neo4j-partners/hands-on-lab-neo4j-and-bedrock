# Lab 0 - Sign In
At the start of this lab you should have been handed credentials for AWS.  In this first section, we're going to use those to sign in.

## Improving the Labs
As you work through these labs, we'd really appreciate your feedback.  One way to help us improve is to open an issue by going [here](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-sagemaker/issues).  Outright bugs, usability suggestions, and general comments are all appreciated.  Pull requests are great too!

## Sign into AWS
We're going to sign into a new AWS account.  You may already have other AWS accounts.  If you use Chrome, you might consider using incognito mode for these exercises.  That's not mandatory though and other browsers work fine too.
Our next step is to open the AWS console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). 

Select "IAM User."

Now enter the Account ID you were given and click "Next."

Enter the IAM user name and Password you were given.  Click the check box for "Remember this account."  Click "Sign in."

We're now authenticated and logged into the AWS console.

In the next lab we'll deploy Neo4j.
